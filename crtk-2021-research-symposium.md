# Raven/dVRK Surgical Robotics Research Symposium

## Objectives

This is an online-only series for sharing within the common platform community.
The overall theme is experimental minimally-invasive surgical robotics research, typically, but not limited to,
work on the Raven and dVRK platforms. The intent is for this symposium to be a recurring online event.

## Symposium Format

Each session will be 1.5 hours in length, with approximately 4-6 presentations. Planned themes include:

1. Perception and Automation in surgical robotics
2. Novel surgical instruments for surgical robots
3. Other topics as submitted including but not limited to
  - Teleoperation
  - Human-Robot Interactions in surgery
  - Computational, sensing, and robotic approaches to surgical skill assessment

## Call for Contributions

Interested speakers should submit a 1/2 page abstract via this
[google form](https://forms.gle/GZv1nKkK9A6n1Tpy5).
New sessions will be scheduled based on the abstracts received.

## Scheduled Sessions
