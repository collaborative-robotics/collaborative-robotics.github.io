The _collaborative-robotics_ organization was originally created to develop a Common API for research in
teleoperated and collaborative robotics, with an initial focus in the domain of medical robotics.

We are developing an abstract definition of this API,
with concrete implementations in the _Collaborative Robotics Toolkit (CRTK)_.
The implementations focus on common shared research platforms, such as the
[da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki)
and [Raven II](https://github.com/uw-biorobotics/raven2),
and other devices commonly used by researchers. The provided implementation uses
[Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org), but could be extended to other middleware.

We also support networking events for researchers in the medical robotics domain.
This includes _AccelNet_ events for researchers interested in the use of artificial intelligence
to improve robotic surgery through enhanced perception, intelligent assistance and autonomy.
